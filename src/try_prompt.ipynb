      "[Solution]\n",
      "1. Let's first calculate the volume of mineral x and mineral y in the specialized sand.\n",
      "2. Since the sand consists of 40% mineral x and 60% mineral y by volume, we can consider a total volume of 100 units.\n",
      "3. Volume of mineral x = 40% of 100 units = 40 units.\n",
      "4. Volume of mineral y = 60% of 100 units = 60 units.\n",
      "5. Now, we need to calculate the weight of each mineral in the specialized sand.\n",
      "6. Mineral x weighs 4 grams per cubic centimeter, so the weight of mineral x in the sand = 40 units * 4 grams = 160 grams.\n",
      "7. Mineral y weighs 3 grams per cubic centimeter, so the weight of mineral y in the sand = 60 units * 3 grams = 180 grams.\n",
      "8. The total weight of the specialized sand combination = weight of mineral x + weight of mineral y = 160 grams + 180 grams = 340 grams.\n",
      "9. Now, we need to convert the weight from grams per cubic centimeter to grams per cubic meter.\n",
      "10. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters in each dimension, the conversion factor for volume is 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000.\n",
      "11. Therefore, the weight of a cubic meter of specialized sand combination = 340 grams * 1,000,000 = 340,000,000 grams.\n",
